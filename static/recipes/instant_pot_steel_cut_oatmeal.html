INGREDIENTS
	2 cups steel cut oats (certified gluten-free, if necessary)
	5 cups water

INSTRUCTIONS
	Combine the steel cut oats and water in the bowl of a 6-quart Instant Pot and give them a stir. 
	Secure the lid and turn the steam release valve at the top to "sealing." 
	Press the Manual or Pressure Cook button, then set the cook time to 4 minutes on high pressure.
	The Instant Pot will read "ON" as it comes to pressure, which can take 10 to 15 minutes.
	When the floating valve in the lid pops up, you'll know the pot is pressurized and the countdown will begin.
	When the cooking cycle is complete, allow the pressure to naturally release for 20 minutes.
	Once the 20 minutes have passed, turn the steam release valve to "venting" to release any remaining pressure. 
	Carefully remove the lid and stir the oats to incorporate any water that has risen to the top.
	They might look watery at first, but should thicken up when you stir them.

To set the delay timer on Instant Pot:
	Press "Manual" button
	Adjust the cooking time with +/- buttons
	Press "Delay Start" button
	Set the delay cooking time with +/- buttons
